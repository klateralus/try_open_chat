# try_open_chat
This is a simple python script to try out open chat gpt.

To test the chat start the file called `run_assistant.bat`.

`run_assistant.bat` will install all the necessary python modules in the same folder and then well start the chat ui.
When you're done with testing, `run_assistant.bat` will clean up the temporal files, only leaving settings intact. 

To use open chat gpt you need to have an API key. 
To learn how to get an API key click "Help -> How to make an api key" in a menu toolbar.
To set a new API key click "Settings -> Preferences". There're a few more settings that can be adjusted.


When you have API key set, you're welcome to use open chat gpt.


Best wishes,
Kirill
